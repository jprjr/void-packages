How to setup new Spectrum2 transports:

Create a configuration file at /etc/spectrum2/transports/${transport}.cfg

Create a new service directory at /etc/sv/spectrum2-${transport}
and symlink to the spectrum2-generic run script.

Example: create /etc/spectrum2/transports/aim.cfg, then

	mkdir -p /etc/sv/spectrum2-aim
	ln -s /etc/sv/spectrum2-generic/run /etc/sv/spectrum2-aim/run

Then enable the service as usual:
	ln -s /etc/sv/spectrum2-aim /var/service/
